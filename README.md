# Deepfake Detection Project


## Overview
This project provides a robust and efficient deepfake detection system powered by advanced machine learning techniques. Deepfake content, including manipulated videos and images, poses a growing threat to information integrity. This model identifies and flags fake content, helping to maintain trust in digital media.

The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for ease of use and flexibility in experimentation.

## Features
- **State-of-the-art model** for detecting deepfakes in videos and images.
- **Notebook-based implementation** for easy customization and experimentation.
- **Multi-format support**, including MP4, AVI, and image files.
- **High accuracy** with a focus on minimizing false positives.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Pre-trained Models**: EfficientNet, XceptionNet
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Tools**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The input media is split into frames, resized, and normalized.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The model extracts subtle facial and temporal inconsistencies.
3. **Classification**: A neural network classifies the content as real or fake.
4. **Result Visualization**: Outputs are annotated media files or detailed reports.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mverma3992/Deepfake-Detection.git
   cd deepfake-detection
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter/ Google Colab.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load your dataset or media files.
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Run the detection model.
   - View and analyze results.
